# My CV

I would describe myself as a very curious person and I think this is also reflected in the various thins I have done so far. The subsequent sections briefly elaborate on the key areas: Education, Professional Experience, and Extracurricular Activities.

## Education

Since August 2021, I have been studying the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Business Administration at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU).

## Professional Experience

This past spring, I did a M&A internship at Clearwater International in Frankfurt. During that time, I worked on three live deals and various marketing campaigns. This was a great learning experience and an important step in my career. From September 2020 to February 2021 I did a Debt Capital Markets internship at Erste Group Bank AG, Austria's largest bank. The fast-paced work environment and the exposure to fixed income instruments and markets gave me the opportunity to experience the dynamics of capital markets. I also did two additional internship. However, they are not very important for a career in finance.

## Extracurricular Activites

After the third semester of my bachelor's degree, I joined Austria's biggest student consultancy. This was definitely one of my best decisions I have ever made, as I have never learned more in such a short period of time. After one semester, I took on the responsibility of leading the sales team. Furthermore, I also joined the Equity Research division of my university's finance association WUTIS - Trading and Investment Society. There I gained important knowledge about corporate finance and valuation. Moreover, I discovered my passion for macroeconomics at WUTIS. This has led me to launch my own website The Macro Project on which I publish articles on different macroeconomic topics.

## Interests

I don't have too many hobbies. But I am a passionate football fan and admirer of stoic philosophy.
