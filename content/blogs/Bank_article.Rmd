## Non- US banks' maturity mismatch and dollar funding gap

One of the fundamental core functions of banking is maturity transformation. To understand this concept, one should look at the two sides of a simplified and theoretical bank balance sheet. Deposits of savers constitute liabilities for the bank, as it is obligated to give money back to savers if they demand so. In order to achieve returns, the bank puts this money to work and purchases assets or originates loans while it only keeps a certain amount of liquidity to serve depositors withdrawing parts of their money. In this case, on the one hand, the bank has these demandable deposits with a relatively short maturity. On the other hand, it finances loans and assets with far longer maturities with these deposits. This is the general principle of maturity transformation that positively contributes to profitability in banking. In respect to the domestic currency, these created maturity mismatches between assets and funding pose little threat, as central banks are able to create domestic currency and provide credit if a bank is not capable of finding adequate funding sources when money is withdrawn. However, this only applies to the domestic currency. Central banks have limited contingents to lend foreign currencies, since they cannot simply create them. Therefore, lending is restricted by the foreign exchange reserves on their balance sheets.

Due to maturity mismatches of dollar assets and liabilities, non-US banks are exposed to funding risks. More precisely, on an aggregate level, these institutions face a $1.4 trillion cross-currency funding gap, which is the difference between their dollar-denominated assets and liabilities that is caused by maturity mismatches and needs to be financed with short-term dollar funding. Since the great financial crisis, especially FX swaps have played an increasingly important role in this context. The extent of such derivatives climbed to about 10% of total assets of non-US banks in 2018, resulting in greater maturity transformation and funding risk because of the short maturities of such swaps.


### Funding fragility and stress factors in funding markets

The IMF argues that weak bank balance sheets paired with market tightening, two interconnected aspects, might initiate stress in funding markets. During the GFC, both of these factors and their effects were observable. In the beginning, miscalculated risk exposed the fragility of banks’ balance sheets and their increased counterparty risk. Subsequently, uncollateralised interbank lending diminished, as banks anticipated losses, increased liquidity, and got reluctant to lend to each other due to the changed risk sentiment. This in turn triggered a shift to FX swap markets and created the funding equivalent of a ‘crowded trade’. Both the risk and the demand for dollars were reflected in a substantial increase in FX swap costs. This increase was observable in a widening of FX swap spreads that deviated far from covered interest rate parity. Due to this, rolling over short-term funding got increasingly difficult and expensive. With the shortening of funding maturity due to a shift towards FX swaps and the increasing maturity of assets caused by reduced liquidity in the markets, the maturity mismatch expanded and a widespread dollar shortage shock emerged.

The example of the GFC shows that a maturity mismatch, while contributing to banking profitability, is an inherent risk factor itself. The figure below shows the growing cross-currency funding gap of non-US banks together with the cross-currency funding ratio, which is the percentage of the cross-currency funding gap financed by short-term FX swaps. This reliance on FX swaps exposes them to funding risk due to the proven volatility of FX swap costs when risk sentiment changes or counterparties become more risk-averse. The second chart illustrates this fact and compares the realised three-month US dollar funding rates of different short-term funding options, including FX swaps.

In addition to the above-mentioned funding vulnerabilities, non-US banks face further dollar-related instabilities and sensitivities that need to be considered in order to generate a holistic overview. First, the US dollar liquidity ratio of non-US banks, which describes the ratio of highly liquid dollar assets to estimated dollar outflows in a brief stress scenario, is well below the general liquidity coverage ratio across currencies. The US dollar stable funding ratio gives the same picture. It is generally lower than the consolidated stable funding ratio across currencies. As it measures stable, long-term funding sources against the assets held in the respective currency, it is also a good indicator for stability in crises.

Regulatory changes, stricter capital requirements, and asymmetries in demand and supply across currency systems lead to increased liquidity needs and deviations from covered interest parity, tightening dollar funding conditions. Basel III introduced capital requirements obligating banks to comply with capital ratios. The 2015 statutory disclosure requirement of the leverage ratio has led to an additional increase in covered interest parity deviations of one-week and one-month FX swap contracts that span across quarters and are included in the disclosed balance sheet. Since then, this has caused additional stress in those funding markets. Moreover, the money market mutual fund reform in 2016 resulted in a reduction of non-bank lending. All of these factors in combination with increased supervision have put pressure on banks.

The fragility of non-US banks’ dollar funding activities outlined above makes it more difficult to obtain dollar funding during periods of distress in the financial markets. Resulting dollar shortages due to restricted willingness to lend have significantly contributed to the appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies. The Broad Trade Weighted US Dollar Index as well as the Emerging Markets Economies Trade Weighted US Dollar Index have been following an upward trajectory since September 2008. Especially in the months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, abrupt increases in the exchange value can be noticed. Other factors also contribute to the appreciation of the dollar during such periods. One of the most important is the dollar’s safe haven currency status in times of distress
