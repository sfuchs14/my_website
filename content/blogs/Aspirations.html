<h2>Other</h2>
<p>At some point in my life, I want to start an initiative that focuses on one of the many problems our world currently faces. It could be in the field of education in third world countries, pollution, or human rights. Having an impact is highly important to me and I can not imagine having a life that is only focused on me and my career.</p>
